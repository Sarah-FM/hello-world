# hello-world
First repo
My Name is Sarah, and I work in a customer facing position, currently trying to discover new opportunities and new experiences, so decided to study Electrical Engineering, I have graduated with a degree in Electronics engineering which would help somehow in understanding the new field I am discovering. 
And as part of that and in order to help me build a good graduation project and relate my experience with my studies, and create good analysis, I have joined online courses to learn more about the evolving world of Data Science.
